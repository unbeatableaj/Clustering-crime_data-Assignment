# Clustering-crime_data-Assignment
# Introduction

Clustering is a technique used in unsupervised machine learning to group similar data points together. In this project, we will be performing clustering on the crime_data.csv dataset to identify different groups of cities based on their crime rates and socio-economic factors.

# Data Description

The crime_data.csv dataset contains 50 rows and 5 columns. The columns include various features of the cities, such as their murder rate, assault rate, percentage of the population in poverty, and more.

# Methodology

We will be using K-means clustering, a popular clustering algorithm, to group cities together based on their crime rates and socio-economic factors. K-means clustering works by partitioning data points into k clusters, where k is a predetermined number. The algorithm then iteratively assigns each data point to the cluster with the closest mean, and recalculates the mean of each cluster until convergence is reached.

We will first preprocess the data by scaling the features to ensure that they have the same scale. Then we will determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method . Finally, we will fit the K-means clustering

# Results

Our analysis showed that the optimal number of clusters for this dataset is 4. The K-means clustering algorithm was able to group cities together based on their crime rates and socio-economic factors. 

# Conclusion

Clustering is a powerful technique for identifying groups of similar data points. In this project, we used K-means clustering to group cities together based on their crime rates and socio-economic factors. Our analysis showed that the optimal number of clusters for this dataset is 4. This information can be used by law enforcement agencies and policymakers to better understand the factors that contribute to crime rates in different cities.

Further analysis can be done on each cluster to identify the unique characteristics of each group of cities and how they differ from each other. This information can be used to develop targeted strategies for reducing crime rates in specific areas.
